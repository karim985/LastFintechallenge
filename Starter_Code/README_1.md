## Kasei Coin

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. Launching a crowd sale will allow people moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

Project Details :

Creating a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.
The crowd sale contract I create will manage the entire crowd sale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. My contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
Project Steps 
Creating the KaseiCoin token contract.
Creating the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.
Creating  the KaseiCoin deployer contract.
Perform a real-world, pre-production test of your crowdsale. In order to do so, you will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
Recording a short video or taking several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.
